  abstract    = "The diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the effective
                 self-diffusion tensor, Deff, are related to the echo intensity
                 in an NMR spin-echo experiment. This relationship is used to
                 design experiments from which Deff is estimated. This estimate
                 is validated using isotropic and anisotropic media, i.e.,
                 water and skeletal muscle. It is shown that significant errors
                 are made in diffusion NMR spectroscopy and imaging of
                 anisotropic skeletal muscle when off-diagonal elements of Deff
                 are ignored, most notably the loss of information needed to
                 determine fiber orientation. Estimation of Deff provides the
                 theoretical basis for a new MRI modality, diffusion tensor
                 imaging, which provides information about tissue
                 microstructure and its physiologic state not contained in
                 scalar quantities such as T1, T2, proton density, or the
                 scalar apparent diffusion constant.",

                 quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic
                 tissues is non-Gaussian. Since tissue structure is responsible
                 for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian
                 behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this
                 method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such
                 as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an
                 extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that
                 requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified
                 image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion
                 coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess
                 kurtosis of the diffusion displacement probability
                 distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure
                 from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult
                 subjects, the excess diffusional kurtosis is found to be
                 significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter,
                 reflecting the structural differences between these two types
                 of cerebral tissues. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is related
                 to q-space imaging methods, but is less demanding in terms of
                 imaging time, hardware requirements, and postprocessing
                 effort. It may be useful for assessing tissue structure
                 abnormalities associated with a variety of neuropathologies.",
